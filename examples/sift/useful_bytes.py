"""A user stat class: useful-byte histograms with cache block utilization.

SIFT's caches sample, for every block they evict, how many of its bytes the
core used (`usefulBytes.<accessor>` in `CacheMemory`, one bucket per byte
count from 0 to the block size).
`UsefulBytes` is a `Histogram` with two methods that only make sense for
that stat; graphix itself knows nothing about it.
