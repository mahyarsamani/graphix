"""Runs and sets of runs: where stats come from.

A `Run` is one gem5 output directory: its labels, its SimObject tree from
`config.json`, and the blocks of one dump, by default its largest
`stats_dump_<N>.txt` (or the last dump of `stats.txt`).
A `RunSet` holds many runs and builds a stat across all of them on request:
`runs["numCycles"]` is one `Scalar` with a value per run and owner.
`RunSet.from_samples` makes one run per dump of a periodically sampled run,
so a stat becomes a time series over its `sample` label.
