"""Group the lines of one dump into stat blocks.

A block is every line of one stat instance: one family name, one owner, one
set of dimension values, and one occurrence.
A scalar is a block with a single plain line; a vector or histogram is a
block of `::<field>` lines, a one-line (`|`) line, or both.
The block's kind comes from its spec, or else from its lines:
- a `samples` field means a histogram (gem5's Distribution and Histogram
  always print it);
- other fields, or a one-line line, mean a vector;
- a single plain line means a scalar.
